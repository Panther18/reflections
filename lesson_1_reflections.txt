How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
1. Identify the modified code easily
2. Easy to identify the broken code
3. Helps to avoid the manual process which is tedious

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1. Easy to identify the changes made over time
2. Helps to revert to a old version of the project and start making changes (maybe due to change in framework or due to a bug)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pros
	we have the control to save after a logical change in the code
	easy to differentiate different versions of the code as they are logically different
	easy to identify the flow of changes made in the past
cons
	we might forget to save
	any manual task is tedious and error prone
	time taking

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git:
	Files that were modified might be inter-related to each other
	All the changes put together represent one logical change to the program
GoogleDrive:
	Files are independent to each other
