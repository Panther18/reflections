How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	staging area contains only those files that you feel are logically changed
	these files will be committed in your next commit
	you can have control on what you can commit/what you cannot commit
direcory:
	contains all the files of the repository + some files not in the repo
	some of these files may not have been tracked by git
repository:
	cotains all the files that are part of the project
	all these files will be tracked by git
